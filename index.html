			<h2><b><u>About Us</b></u></h2>
			<h4>History:</h4>
			<div>
			We were founded in 2014 by The Lovely Family in Atkinson, NH. In the beginning we sold only dog supplies. Over the years we have expanded our product line to include cat and fish supplies.We now have multiple locations in Atkinson, Tilton and Durham, New Hampshire.
			</div>
			<h4>Why use us?:</h4>
			<div>
			We love animals and we understand that they are more than just pets, they are family. We do not sell any products that we would not personally use or give to our animal family members. We also donate 5% of every purchase to the NHSPCA.
